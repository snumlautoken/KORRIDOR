# KORRIDOR

KORRIDOR is currently in early development, but should be testable in its current state.

To build, simply make sure to have `glfw`, `GLEW` and `glm` installed.

You can then build the program using `cmake .` followed by `make`.

You may also define the game scene yourself by editing the `main.cpp` file.

It has only been tested for Linux.
